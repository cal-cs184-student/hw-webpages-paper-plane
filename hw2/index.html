		<h2>Overview</h2>

			In Homework 2, the two main concepts we focused on were Bezier curves and triangle meshes implemented with the half-edge data structure. Bezier curves, and by extension Bezier surfaces, are used to create smooth curves and surfaces through de Castelijau's algorithm. Another way to represent a smooth surface is through triangle meshes, which makes up the second main concept of this assignment. We implemented various operations with triangle meshes which included edge splitting and edge flipping. Using these operations, we can subdivide an elementary mesh into a smoother one with more detail. Both approaches give us a way to construct arbitrary meshes.

			<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

			<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

			For each iteration of de Castelijau's algorithm, we calculate a new control point by interpolating between the current point and the next point using the parameter \(t\). Through every iteration, we get one less control point than before. Eventually, by iterating through this process, you will end up with a single point, which is the final answer. <br>

Starting from left to right, top to bottom, the first 6 images demonstrate the calculation of control points until we arrive at a final point \(t\). The 7th image shows the resultant curve and the 8th image shows the resultant curve when the positions of the control points are modified.  <br></figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>

			With surfaces, we build on top of de Castelijau's algorithm from Part 1 as the basis for a 1D evaluation. We have a 2D matrix of control points, which are evaluated first by calculating all the 1D curves based on the rows of the control points with some scalar interpolated value \(u\). Each 1D evaluation produces a single point, and the final point can be calculated as another 1D evaluation of all the previous points with some scalar interpolated value \(v\). <br>

			</figure>

			<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

			<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>

			We loop through all the half edges pointing away from the vertex using <code>h->twin()->next()</code>, each of which corresponds to a separate face. We add <code>Face::normal()</code> to a running total since it is already normalized by the area of the face. (This is because the cross products of the vertices scale by the area, which are normalized out.) Finally, we normalize the total sum to get the normal corresponding to the vertex.

			</figure>

			<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
			We assume the first halfedge is BC and it's twin is CB. This gives us a systematic way to label all the knowns we have. We map the faces ABC &#x2192; ABD, DCB &#x2192; DCA and the edge (and corresponding half-edges) BC &#x2192; AD. Using this mapping, we can deduce the appropriate pointers for each half-edge. We also update the half-edge pointers for the vertices B, C and the faces, since they could be pointing to the old half-edge components. If the edge is a boundary edge, then we return immediately. <br>

			For us, implementing the edge flip was relatively straightforward after our systematic labeling scheme, and no major bugs were encountered. <br>

				<figcaption> <br> Figure 4: The teapot mesh with some edges flipped. Note several edge flip phenomena, such as depressions in the mesh creating shading artefacts, or near-degenerate flips creating triangles which seem to be larger than others. <br> </figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
			Similar to an edge flip, we assume the edge being split is BC, and the corresponding half-edges are BC and CB. We label the current knowns, and the existing faces by their exterior half-edges CA and DC (which will correspond to CAM and DCM). We create: (1) 1 new vertex M with its position the mean of vertices B and C, mapping the edge BC &#x2192; MC, (2) 2 new faces ABM and BDM, (3) 3 edges MA, MB, MD, and (4) their 6 corresponding half-edges. The edge MB is part of the original edge BC, so for our Loop subdivision algorithm, it is technically considered an old edge. Like with our edge flip implementation, we set and update the half-edge pointers for existing and new half-edges based on the mapping defined above. We similarly update the half-edge pointers for the faces CAM and DCM, and the vertex B, since they could be pointing to old half-edge components which have changed. <br>

			For us, implementing the edge split was difficult because we did not read the instructions carefully and forgot to set the position of the new vertex M to be the mean of vertices B and C.

			</figure>

			If the edge is a boundary edge, then we do not need to consider the faces DCM and BDM. We create the new vertex similarly, mapping BC &#x2192; MC, but this time, there is only (1) 1 new face ABM, (2) 2 new edges MA, MB, and (3) their 4 corresponding half-edges. Similar to the above, the edge MB is not new under Loop subdivision rules. The half-edge pointers of face CAM and vertex B are updated. <br>

			<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
			We implemented Loop subdivision using the steps described in the specification. This consists of
			<ol>
				<li>Computing new positions for existing vertices using the weighted sum of the existing vertex position \(p\), the sum of the neighbors' positions \(p_i\), and the number of neighbors \(n\) via the formula.
				</li>
				\[\begin{align*}
				S(p) &= (1 - \alpha_n) p + \alpha_n \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} p_i, \\
				\alpha_n &= \begin{cases}
				9/16 & n = 3, \\
				3/8 & n > 3.
				\end{cases}
				\end{align*}\]
				<li>Computing positions for new vertices formed by splitting edges by looping through existing edges (and indexing them for the step 3). We use a similar weighted sum of adjacent vertex positions, with a weight of \( \frac{3}{8} \) for near vertices and \( \frac{1}{8} \) for far vertices. Far halfedges (corresponding to far vertices) are computed <code>h->next()->next()</code> using the near halfedge <code>h</code> (corresponding to near vertices).
				</li>
				<li>Splitting every existing edge by iterating through the existing edge index and setting the position of the new vertex to the position calculated in step 2.</li>
				<li>Flip any new edge that connects an old and new vertex.</li>
				<li>Setting the position of the old vertices to the positions calculated in step 1.
				</li>
			</ol>

				<figcaption><br> Figure 7: Five successive Loop subdivisions applied to the cube mesh, starting at 0 subdivisions applied, and going first left to right then top to bottom. Observe the gradual smoothing of the cube's sharp edges. Because the cube mesh is fundamentally asymmetric, this also results in an asymmetric smoothed mesh. <br></figcaption>
			</figure>

			We can see that as a result of Loop subdivision, each triangular face is effectively split into four, which naturally causes the mesh to become smoother. Repositioning the location of the mesh vertices create a semi-interpolation of the face surface normal. As a result, sharp corners or edges, which visually result from rapid changes in the surface normal, are also smoothened as a result of this interpolation. This effect can be mitigated by presplitting edges near the sharp corners or edges, bringing the vertices closer together and hence, reducing the degree of interpolation. <br>

Starting from left to right, top to bottom, we presplit edges so that the cube is symmetric. As shown in the next two figures, for each successive subdivision, we flip and split certain edges to continually ensure symmetry. After several subdivisions, the final figure demonstrates the relative preservation of symmetry compared to Figure 7. <br></figcaption>
			</figure>

			For us, Loop subdivision was relatively difficult to debug (and not due to some silly error). We encountered several issues with keeping track of new and old edges, and resetting the intermediete new positions properly. <br>

			For extra credit, we implemented \(\sqrt{3}\) subdivision according to the original 2000 paper by <a href="https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/media/papers/sqrt31.pdf">Leif Kobbelt</a>. We first implement a function to split a face into three faces. We assume the half-edge pointer of the input face is the edge AB, and label the knowns. We then create (1) 1 new vertex M with its position the mean of the vertices A, B, C, (2) 2 new faces BCM, CAM (mapping the existing face ABC &#x2192; ABM), (3) 3 new edges MA, MB, MC, and (4) their 6 corresponding half-edges. Beyond updating and setting new and existing half-edge pointers, we only need to additionally update the half-edge pointer of the input face. <br>

			The algorithm compared to Loop subdivision is then remarkably similar, consisting of the steps
			<ol>
				<li>Computing new positions for existing vertices using the same formula, except with</li>
				\[ \alpha_n = \frac{4 - 2 \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{n} \right) }{9} \]
				<li>Indexing then splitting every existing face in the mesh.</li>
				<li>Flipping all original edges.</li>
				<li>Setting the position of the old vertices to the positions calculated in step 1.</li>
			</ol>

			</figure>

			The beauty of \(\sqrt(3)\) subdivision is that the implementation already supports boundary edges out of the box. Splitting faces and updating the position of existing vertices both work independently of whether or not a connected edge is a boundary.
